  Instrument:
    description: >
      Describes the Instrument used to capture the Image. It serves as a container
      for hardware components included in a Microscope, such as Microscope Stand,
      Microscope Table, Light Source, Light Source Coupling, Sample Holder, Focusing,
      Objective, Filter, Dichroic, Additional Lens (e.g., Magnification Changer/Optovar),
      Additional Mirroring Device, Polarization Optics, Prism, Optical Aperture,
      Optical Device, Detector, and Calibration Tool. Filters can be separate Excitation,
      Emission filters, Dichroic mirrors, or a single Filter Set. Instruments may have
      multiple Light Sources, Detectors, Objectives, and Filters. Each component has
      its own ID, referenced by Image, Plane, or Channel elements in an Image Acquisition session.
      The Light Path configuration can vary per Channel but not per timepoint or Plane of an XYZ stack.

      Iris:
        description: >
          Indicates whether (True) or not (False) the Objective is fitted with an Iris.
          High NA Objectives may have an internal Iris Diaphragm to increase image contrast
          by compensating for image flare artifacts. Adjusting the Iris Diaphragm changes
          the Objective's rear aperture size, yielding a variable NA range between 0.5 and
          the Objective's upper limit.

          An Infinity-corrected Objective is corrected for an infinite sample-to-image
          distance and requires use with a Tube Lens of appropriate focal length to obtain
          its nominal magnification.

      CorrectionCollar:
        description: >
          Indicates whether (True) the Objective is fitted with a Correction Collar.
          High NA dry Objectives (NA 0.8+) may suffer image degradation due to cover glass
          thickness variations, immersion medium, and temperature changes. A Correction Collar
          compensates for these by adjusting the central lens group position to correct optical path
          length deviations caused by changes in cover glass thickness, immersion liquid nature,
          numerical apertures, and temperature.

          of the Phase Plate found in this Objective (see: https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/phase-contrast/phase-contrast-Microscope-configuration).
