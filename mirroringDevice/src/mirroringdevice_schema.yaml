    description: This element describes the Instrument used to capture the Image.
      It is primarily a container referring to the list of hardware components included
      in a given Microscope. The list consists of the Microscope Stand, Microscope
      Table, Light Source, Light Source Coupling, Sample Holder, Focusing, Objective,
      Filter, Dichroic, Additional Lens (including a commonly used Magnification Changer,
      also known as Optovar), Additional Mirroring Device, Polarization Optics, Prism,
      Optical Aperture, Optical Device, Detector and Calibration Tool. The Filter
      element can be either composed of separate Excitation, Emission filters, and
      Dichroic mirrors or a single Filter Set. An Instrument might have multiple Light
      Sources, Detectors, Objectives, and Filters, etc. Each of these has its own
      ID attribute, which can be referred to from the Image, Plane or more commonly
      Channel elements associated with a given Image Acquisition session. It is understood
      that the Light Path configuration can be different for each Channel, but cannot
      be different for each timepoint or each Plane of an XYZ stack.

        description: A Dichroic Mirror (also often referred to as Dichroic Beamsplitter
          or simply as Dichroic) is a Mirror that spectrally separate light by transmitting
          and reflecting light as a function of wavelength. In the context of fluorescence
          microscopy, they are typically used to reflect the excitation light, but
          transmit the emitted fluorescence. Dichroic Mirrors can be categorized in
          different manners. However, the most important criteria for choosing a Dichoric
          Mirror are the Transmittance and the Reflectance Wavelength ranges. This
          element describes a generic Additional Dichroic positioned in the Ligth
          Path for one or more Channel available for this Instrument.
