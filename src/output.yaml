    attributes:
      ID:
        description: A Unique Identifier for this component.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        range: LSID
      Magnification:
        description: This field captures the Magnification of the Objective as specified
          by the Manufacturer - i.e., 60 represents a 60X lens.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        required: true
        range: float_with_unit
      LensNA:
        description: This field captures the nominal Numerical Aperture (NA) of this
          Objective as specified by the Manufacturer, expressed as a floating-point
          (real) number (e.g. 1.27 NA). NA is a number that was defined initially
          by Abbe to characterize Objectives and Condensers. NA can be calculated
          by the expression n sin alpha, where n is the Refractive Index of the medium
          between the Lens and the Sample, and alpha is half the Angular Aperture
          of the Lens. NA is a measure of how much of the illumination that leaves
          the specimen actually passes through the Lens. The larger the NA, the more
          information the lens can transmit. Expected range 0.02 - 1.5.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        required: true
        range: float_with_unit
      Correction:
        description: This field captures the type of optical correction (i.e. chromatic
          correction, or flatness correction, etc.) associated with this Objective.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        required: true
        range: ObjectiveCorrection
      ImmersionType:
        description: According to ISO 10934-1:2002, an Immersion Liquid is a liquid
          (commonly immersion oil, water or glycerol) specified as suitable for use
          in the space between the front of an immersion lens and the object NOTE
          Because the immersion liquid is considered in the computing of corrections
          to be part of the lens, its refractive index and dispersion (or Abbe number)
          are critical. Please refer to ISO 8036-1 for more details on Immersion Oil.
          This field describes the general category of the Immersion Liquid this Objective
          is designed for, according to the Manufacturer. If the general category
          is not "Air", the actual Immersion Liquid that was used during the Acquisition
          of a specific Image must be specified in Objective Settings.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        range: ImmersionTypeList
      WorkingDistance:
        description: This field reports the Working Distance of this Objective under
          normal operating conditions. The Working Distance is the distance (in air,
          or in the specified immersion liquid) between the front of an Objective
          and the surface of the cover glass or of the specimen if uncovered.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        range: float_with_unit
      Iris:
        description: This field records whether (True) or not (False) the Objective
          was fitted with an Iris. Manufacturers offer high NA Objectives, which are
          equipped with an internal Iris Diaphragm that increases image contrast during
          digital imaging to compensate for image flare artifacts due to light emitted
          from areas outside the focal plane. Opening or closing the Iris Diaphragm
          determines the size of the Objective rear aperture yielding a variable NA
          range between 0.5 and the Objective's upper limit.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        range: boolean
      CalibratedMagnification:
        description: This field captures the Magnification of the Objective as measured
          via a calibration process- i.e., '59.987' for a 60x lens.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        range: float_with_unit
      AnnotationRef:
        description: This is an empty element that refers to an Annotation (typically
          a Comment Annotation that consists of a simple multi-line comment) describing
          this component.
        multivalued: true
        cardinality: 0 ... âˆž

        description: A User-defined Name for this component.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        range: Denomination
      InfinityCorrected:
        description: This field records whether (True) or not (False) this Objective
          is infinity corrected. An Infinity-corrected Objective is corrected for
          an infinite sample to primary image distance and needs to be used with a
          Tube Lens of appropriate focal length to obtains its nominal magnification.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        range: boolean
      ContrastModulation:
        description: This field specifies the presence in this Objective of a contrast
          modulation plate, such as a Phase Ring (Ph1, Ph2, Ph3), a Hoffman modulator,
          a Varel modulator, or similar.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        required: true
        range: ContrastModulationPlate
      DIC:
        description: This field specifies whether (True) the Objective is designed
          for Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) or not (False). DIC is a contrast
          modality due to double-beam interference in which two waves that fall on
          the object plane or image plane are separated laterally by a distance similar
          to the minimum resolvable distance.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        required: true
        range: boolean
      LightType:
        description: This field specifies whether this Objective is designed for a
          special Light application (e.g., IR or UV).
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        required: true
        range: ObjectiveLightType
      CorrectionCollar:
        description: This field records whether (True) or not (False) the Objective
          was fitted with a Correction Collar. When using high NA dry Objectives (NA
          0.8 or greater), cover glass thickness variations of only a few micrometers,
          immersion medium, and temperature changes result in dramatic image degradation
          due to aberration. To compensate for these errors, the more highly corrected
          Objectives are equipped with a Correction Collar mechanism, which is provided
          to adjust the central lens group position to compensate for deviations from
          correct optical path length due to changes in Cover Glass Thickness, the
          nature of the Immersion Liquid, different Numerical Apertures, and Temperature.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
        range: boolean
      CorrectionCollarType:
        description: This field records the type of Correction Collar with which this
          Objective is fitted. In case the Objective has more than one Correction
          Collar please enter "Multi" and provide more details in Description.
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        range: CorrectionCollarTypeList
      DippingMedium:
        description: In case the Immersion Type for this Objective is designated as
          "Dipping", this field captures the type of Dipping Medium this Objective
          is compatible with. Examples include, water-based (biological buffers, culture
          media, other water-based solutions) organic-based [FocusClear (CLARITY);
          CUBIC-1, CUBIC-2, CUBIC-R1, CUBIC-R2; 2,2-thiodiethanol (TDE); ethyl cinnamate;
          Benzyl Benzoate and BB-PEG (PEGASOS); Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate (BABB);
          dibenzyl ether (DBE); 100% Ethanol].
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        range: DippingType
      PhaseContrastDesignation:
        description: 'If the Objective is designed for Phase, this field specifies
          the Phase Contrast designation of the Phase Plate found in this Objective
          (see: https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/phase-contrast/phase-contrast-Microscope-configuration).
          This designation has to match the Phase Number of the Phase Ring associated
          with the front focal plane of the Condenser.'
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: 'NULL'
        range: PhaseContrastDesignationType
      ObjectiveViewField:
        description: 'This field records the maximal diameter of the view field allowed
          by this Objective, expressed in mm, and measured at the intermediate image
          plane. NB: The field of view is influenced by the magnification and diameter
          of the ocular (eyepiece) field diaphragm, but also by the limits imposed
          by the design of the Objective.'
        multivalued: false
        cardinality: R
